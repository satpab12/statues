The Statue of Unity in Gujarat, India, is the tallest statue in the world,
 standing at 182 meters (597 feet). It honors Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent
 leader in India's independence movement. Situated on the Sadhu-Bet Island
 near the Sardar Sarovar Dam, the statue offers stunning views of the 
surrounding landscape. Construction began in 2013 and was completed in 
2018. The statue represents unity, strength, and Patel's significant 
role in integrating princely states into the Indian Union. It has become
 a symbol of national pride and a popular tourist attraction, featuring
 a museum, exhibition halls, and an observation deck.
